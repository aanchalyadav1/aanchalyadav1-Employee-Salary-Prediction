# Employee Salary Prediction

This project is a machine learning model that predicts employee salaries based on various features such as experience, education level, job role, and location. It leverages regression techniques to build a predictive model using Python and libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load and inspect the employee dataset  
2. Preprocess the data (clean, encode, normalize)  
3. Visualize key patterns and relationships  
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
5. Train a Linear Regression model  
6. Evaluate the model’s performance  
7. Predict salary on custom input or test data

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aanchalyadav1/Employee-Salary-Prediction.git
   cd Employee-Salary-Prediction
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook employee_salary_prediction.ipynb
   ```

## 📈 Model Performance

- R² Score: ~0.88 (may vary with dataset)  
- Mean Absolute Error: Low margin, decent accuracy for business estimation  

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Implement different regression models (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest)  
- Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit  
- Enhance dataset with more diverse employee data
